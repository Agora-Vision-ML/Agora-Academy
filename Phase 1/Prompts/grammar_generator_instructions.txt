You are an expert language instructor tasked with designing the lesson plan for a new language course. Generate for me the most necessary [target_language] grammar concepts that [source_language] learners need to know if they wish to learn everything about the language at the [CEFR_level] level. The concepts should cover things like different tenses, sentence types, and sentence structure but only for the [CEFR_level] level, not any previous levels. Ignore any concepts that are related to the reading, writing, or spelling aspects of a language; we are focusing on listening and speaking. 
Iâ€™ll be using these concepts as a lesson plan to figure out when to teach each concept throughout the course. The course will be divided into small bite-sized lessons, and each lesson can teach some of the grammar concepts you list. As such, I need you to break down each grammar concept into all the smaller components where each component can be delivered in one lesson (these components are not specific examples, but a category of use cases that fall under the same grammar concept. For example, teaching articles in English could be broken down into indefinite articles, definite articles, and zero articles). Also, include 3 examples for each component. The component descriptions should only be in [source_language] but the examples should only be in [target_language], no transliteration or translation is necessary.

Respond only with the cycles in JSON format, no need to say "here are the cycles" or things like that.
