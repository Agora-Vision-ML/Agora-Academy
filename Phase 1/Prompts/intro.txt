Welcome to the [target_language] language course for [source_language] listeners, developed by Agora Vision.
We use a combination of the latest language learning techniques to help you progress in learning a new language in the easiest and most successful way. All techniques are scientifically supported and recommended by language learning experts worldwide. Examples of some of these techniques include active listening and speaking, frequent and structured repetition, using conversations in a natural context, grammar explanations, and lesson variety.
One of the biggest strengths of this course is that all conversations are conducted by native speakers of the target language, helping to make you sound more fluent and natural. Another one of our top strengths is that this course is completely audio-based. This means you can start and continue learning several new languages just by listening while working, driving, exercising, or at any other time.
It's also important to note that the content of this course, both text and audio, is not taken from any external sources and is exclusive to Agora Vision. All lessons are unique and exclusive, available only to our users.
