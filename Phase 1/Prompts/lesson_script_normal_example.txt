Narrator) Welcome back to our Kurdish Sorani language course! We’re in Topic #1 - Greetings and Introductions, and this is our second standard lesson. In our last lesson, we learned basic greetings and how to ask how someone is doing. Today, we'll learn how to introduce ourselves and others by name. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to tell people your name, ask for others' names, and express pleasure at meeting someone new. Let's get started!
Man) سڵاو!
Woman) سڵاو! چۆنی؟
Man) باشم، سوپاس. ناوم کاروانە. ناوت چییە؟
Woman) ناوم شیلانە. خۆشحاڵم بە ناسینت.
Man) منیش خۆشحاڵم. ئەو کێیە؟
Woman) ناوی سارایە.
Man) ناوی چییە؟
Woman) ناوی سارایە.
Narrator) Let's learn how to say our first new word: the word for "name". Listen and repeat after the man:
Man) ناو
[pause]
Man) ناو
[pause]
Narrator) Great! This is an important word we'll use a lot when introducing ourselves. Now let's learn how to say "My name is Shilan" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Woman) شیلانە
[pause]
Woman) شیلانە
[pause]
Woman) ناوم
[pause]
Woman) ناوم
[pause]
Woman) ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Narrator) In this phrase, "ناوم" means "my name" and the ending sound connects your name to the phrase. So "ناوم شیلانە" literally means "my name is Shilan."
Narrator) Let's understand the grammar behind saying "My name is..." In Kurdish Sorani, instead of using a separate word for "is" like in English, we attach endings to words.
In our last lesson, we learned how to use these endings with adjectives, like "باشم" (I am good) and "باشیت" (you are good). Now we're learning how to use them with nouns.
When we say "ناوم شیلانە", the "م" attached to "ناو" means "my", making "ناوم" mean "my name". The ending connects your name to the phrase.
Narrator) Now let's learn how to say "what" in Kurdish Sorani. This is an important question word. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man) چی
[pause]
Man) چی
[pause]
Narrator) Excellent! We'll use this word to ask questions about names.
Narrator) Now let's learn how to ask "What is your name?" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man) ناوت چییە
[pause]
Man) چییە
[pause]
Man) چییە
[pause]
Man) ناوت
[pause]
Man) ناوت
[pause]
Man) ناوت چییە
[pause]
Narrator) In this phrase, "ناوت" means "your name" and "چییە" means "what is". So "ناوت چییە؟" literally asks "your name what is?"
Narrator) When forming a "what" question, we place "چی" before the connecting sound. So "چییە" means "what is".
Narrator) Our next word is "ئەو", which means "he" or "she" in Kurdish Sorani. Kurdish doesn't distinguish between male and female in third-person pronouns. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) ئەو
[pause]
Woman) ئەو
[pause]
Narrator) Great! This is our third personal pronoun. Now we have all three singular subject pronouns in Kurdish Sorani: "من" for "I", "تۆ" for "You", and "ئەو" for "He or She". Unlike English, Kurdish Sorani doesn't distinguish between "he" and "she" - both are simply "ئەو". This makes things a bit simpler!
Just like we saw with "من" and "تۆ", "ئەو" can be used as the subject of a sentence. For example, "ئەو باشە" means "He or She is good."
Narrator) Now let's learn how to ask "What is his or her name?" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) ناوی چییە
[pause]
Woman) چییە
[pause]
Woman) چییە
[pause]
Woman) ناوی
[pause]
Woman) ناوی
[pause]
Woman) ناوی چییە
[pause]
Narrator) Our next word means "happy" or "pleased" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man) خۆشحاڵ
[pause]
Man) حاڵ
[pause]
Man) حاڵ
[pause]
Man) خۆش
[pause]
Man) خۆش
[pause]
Man) خۆشحاڵ
[pause]
Narrator) Excellent! This word will help us express pleasure when meeting someone.
Narrator) Our next word means "to know" or "to meet or be acquainted with" someone in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) ناسین
[pause]
Woman) سین
[pause]
Woman) سین
[pause]
Woman) نا
[pause]
Woman) نا
[pause]
Woman) ناسین
[pause]
Narrator) Great! We'll use this word to express pleasure at meeting someone.
Narrator) Now let's combine these words to say "Pleased to meet you" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man) خۆشحاڵم بە ناسینت
[pause]
Man) ناسینت
[pause]
Man) ناسینت
[pause]
Man) بە
[pause]
Man) بە
[pause]
Man) خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Man) خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Man) خۆشحاڵم بە ناسینت
[pause]
Narrator) In this phrase, "خۆشحاڵم" means "I am happy", "بە" means "with" or "by", and "ناسینت" means "meeting you" or "knowing you". So "خۆشحاڵم بە ناسینت" literally means "I am happy by meeting you."
Narrator) Our last new word means "me too" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) منیش
[pause]
Woman) منیش
[pause]
Narrator) Great! This is formed by getting the word for "من" and connecting it to a suffix, which makes it mean "me too".
Narrator) Now let's learn how to say "I'm pleased too" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman) منیش خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Woman) خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Woman) خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Woman) منیش
[pause]
Woman) منیش
[pause]
Woman) منیش خۆشحاڵم
[pause]
Narrator) We learned how "منیش" means "me too" or "I also". So "منیش خۆشحاڵم" literally means "I am also happy" - a perfect response when someone says they're pleased to meet you.
