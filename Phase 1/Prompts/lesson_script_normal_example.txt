Narrator) Welcome back to our Kurdish Sorani language course! We're in Topic #1 - Greetings and Introductions, and this is our second lesson. In our last lesson, we learned basic greetings and how to ask how someone is doing. Today, we'll learn how to introduce ourselves and ask for someone's name. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to tell people your name and ask for others' names. Let's get started!
Man)  سڵاو!
Woman)  سڵاو! چۆنی؟
Man)  باشم، سوپاس. من کاروانم. ناوم کاروانە. ناوت چییە؟
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە.
Man)  باشە. سوپاس.
Woman)  خواحافیز.
Man)  خواحافیز.
Narrator) Let's learn our first new word, which means "I" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man)  من
[pause]
Man)  من
[pause]
Narrator) Great! This is the personal pronoun for "I" in Kurdish Sorani. You'll use this word when talking about yourself.
Narrator) Now let's learn the word for "you" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman)  تۆ
[pause]
Woman)  تۆ
[pause]
Narrator) Excellent! This is the personal pronoun for "you" in Kurdish Sorani. You'll use this when addressing someone directly.
Narrator) We've just learned two important personal pronouns in Kurdish Sorani: "من" meaning "I" and "تۆ" meaning "you". These are used at the beginning of sentences when you want to talk about yourself or address someone else. For example, if you want to say "I am good", you would say "من باشم". Similarly, if you want to say "You are good", you would say "تۆ باشیت". Notice how the ending of the word "باش" changes depending on who we're talking about.
Narrator) Let's practice using these pronouns. How would you say "I am good" in Kurdish Sorani?
[pause]
Man)  من باشم
Narrator) And how would you say "You are good"?
[pause]
Woman)  تۆ باشیت
Narrator) Now let's learn how to ask "What is your name?" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man)  ناوت چییە؟
[pause]
Man)  چییە
[pause]
Man)  چییە
[pause]
Man)  ناوت
[pause]
Man)  ناوت
[pause]
Man)  ناوت چییە؟
[pause]
Narrator) Excellent! Now let's learn how to say "My name is Shilan" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Woman)  شیلانە
[pause]
Woman)  شیلانە
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Narrator) Great! In this phrase, "ناوم" means "my name" and "ە" at the end of the name connects your name to the phrase. Now let's learn how to say "I am Karwan" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the man:
Man)  من کاروانم
[pause]
Man)  کاروانم
[pause]
Man)  کاروانم
[pause]
Man)  من
[pause]
Man)  من
[pause]
Man)  من کاروانم
[pause]
Narrator) Excellent! This phrase uses your name and the suffix "م" which connects the pronoun to your name. Now let's learn how to say "My name is Shilan, what is your name?" in Kurdish Sorani. Listen and repeat after the woman:
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە، ناوت چییە؟
[pause]
Woman)  ناوت چییە
[pause]
Woman)  ناوت چییە
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە
[pause]
Woman)  ناوم شیلانە، ناوت چییە؟
[pause]
Narrator) Great! This combines the two phrases we just learned. We've learned two ways to introduce yourself in Kurdish Sorani. The first way is to say "ناوم" followed by your name and "ە", like "ناوم شیلانە" meaning "My name is Shilan". The second way is to use the pronoun "من" followed by your name and the suffix "م", like "من کاروانم" meaning "I am Karwan". Both ways are commonly used and correct.
