Narrator) Welcome back to our Kurdish Sorani language course! This is the final lesson of Topic #1 - Greetings and Introductions. Today, we'll review everything we've learned so far through a story and some interactive exercises. This will help you practice using all the greetings, introductions, and basic conversation phrases we've covered in a real-life context. Let's get started!
Narrator) Throughout this topic, we've learned several categories of essential words. For greetings, we learned سڵاو, بەیانی باش, and شەو باش. We covered personal pronouns like من, تۆ, and ئەو. We learned the question word چی. We learned how to give yes or no responses with بەڵێ and نەخێر. And we learned how to politely converse with سوپاس, خۆشحاڵم, بەخێربێیت, and تکایە.
Narrator) Now, let's put everything we've learned into practice with a story. Our story features two characters: ئازاد, a young man who has just arrived in Kurdistan for the first time, and شیلان, a friendly local who helps tourists. They meet at a small café in the morning. As you listen to their conversation, pay attention to the greetings and introductions they use. This will help you understand how these phrases are used in real-life situations. Here we go:
Narrator) It's early morning in a small café in Kurdistan. ئازاد has just arrived and looks a bit lost. شیلان, who works at the café, notices him and approaches.
شیلان) بەیانی باش!
ئازاد) بەیانی باش.
شیلان) چۆنی؟
ئازاد) باشم، سوپاس. تۆ باشیت؟
شیلان) من باشم، سوپاس. ناوم شیلانە. ناوت چییە؟
ئازاد) ناوم ئازادە. خۆشحاڵم بە ناسینت.
شیلان) منیش خۆشحاڵم. بەخێربێیت!
Narrator) شیلان notices that ئازاد seems new to the area and decides to offer some help.
شیلان) تۆ باشیت؟
ئازاد) بەڵێ، سوپاس.
Narrator) شیلان gestures to indicate that she can help him.
ئازاد) سوپاس!
Narrator) They sit down at a table, and شیلان brings some tea.
شیلان) تکایە.
ئازاد) سوپاس.
Narrator) After a while, ئازاد needs to leave.
ئازاد) سوپاس. شەو باش.
شیلان) شەو باش!
Narrator) ئازاد realizes it's still morning and corrects himself.
ئازاد) نەخێر، بەیانی باش!
شیلان) بەیانی باش!
Narrator) They both laugh, and ئازاد leaves the café, feeling welcomed in this new place.
Narrator) Now, let's see how well you understood the story. What does شیلان give to ئازاد at the cafe?
[pause]
Narrator) The correct answer is: tea.
Narrator) What mistake did ئازاد make when saying goodbye?
[pause]
Narrator) The correct answer is: He said شەو باش instead of بەیانی باش because it was still morning time.
Narrator) Now it's your turn to practice! You'll play the role of ئازاد, and I'll be شیلان. Try to respond as ئازاد did in the story. Let's begin.
شیلان) بەیانی باش!
Narrator) Respond with good morning.
[pause]
شیلان) چۆنی؟
Narrator) Say you are good and ask how she is.
[pause]
شیلان) من باشم، سوپاس. ناوم شیلانە. ناوت چییە؟
Narrator) Tell her your name is Azad and that you're pleased to meet her.
[pause]
شیلان) منیش خۆشحاڵم. بەخێربێیت!
شیلان) تۆ باشیت؟
Narrator) Say yes thank you.
[pause]
شیلان) تکایە.
Narrator) Say thank you.
[pause]
Narrator) After a while, you need to leave.
Narrator) Say good night (which is incorrect).
[pause]
شیلان) شەو باش!
Narrator) Now realize it's still morning and correct yourself by saying good morning.
[pause]
شیلان) بەیانی باش!
Narrator) Now let's try a slightly different scenario. This time, it's evening instead of morning, and you're not feeling well. Also, شیلان will ask about someone else. You'll still play the role of ئازاد, but you'll need to respond differently, and this time I won’t give hints. Let's begin.
شیلان) سڵاو!
[pause]
شیلان) چۆنی؟
[pause]
شیلان) من باشم، سوپاس. ناوم شیلانە. ناوت چییە؟
[pause]
شیلان) منیش خۆشحاڵم. بەخێربێیت!
Narrator) شیلان notices that you seem new to the area and decides to offer some help.
شیلان) تۆ باشیت؟
[pause]
Narrator) شیلان points to the driver that brought you to the cafe.
شیلان) ناوی چییە؟
[pause]
Narrator) شیلان offers some tea.
شیلان) تکایە.
[pause]
Narrator) After a while, you need to leave.
[pause]
شیلان) بەیانی باش.
Narrator) Realize you made a mistake and correct yourself
[pause]
شیلان) شەو باش!
Narrator) Excellent job! You've completed the final lesson of our first topic, "Greetings and Introductions." You now know how to greet people, introduce yourself, ask for names, express how you're feeling, and use basic polite expressions in Kurdish Sorani. These are the building blocks for all future conversations.
Narrator) In our next topic, we'll build on these foundations and learn how to talk about tourism in Kurdistan - discussing places to visit, asking for directions, and expressing preferences. Keep practicing what you've learned so far, and we'll see you in the next topic!
