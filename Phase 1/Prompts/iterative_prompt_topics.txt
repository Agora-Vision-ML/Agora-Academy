We start at the highest level of the course generation process. Assign the topics to each cycle we will have so that we know the progression of the course.
Cycles are small batches of 3 lessons, so they shouldn't be too broad. The end goal of each cycle is to teach the learner a new collection of phrases they can use in their everyday life when it comes to [topic_of_interest]. You should have around [num_topics] cycles.
Your response should be an array in JSON format where each cycle is an object that contains:
- topic: a conversation topic
- newSkills: the 3-5 newly learned skills
- newPhrases: around 10 newly learned phrases
The phrases should have an equal number of questions and answers, so that whatever question the student learns to ask they can also respond to if someone else asks them.
Keep in mind that all your new phrases should be written in [target_language], and all your topics should be written in [source_language]. The new skills can be written in English.

Respond only with the cycles in JSON format, no need to say "here are the cycles" or things like that.
